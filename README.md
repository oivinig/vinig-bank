# Vini G Bank

The idea for this project is to create a Fictional Bank using the following principles:
    - Microsservices Architecture;
    - Clean Archictecture;
    - SOLID;
    - Domain Driven Design;

## Project Structure

- Every app is a microsservice.
- This project serves as a "monorepo" that builds all services/applications.
